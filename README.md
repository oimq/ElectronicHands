# ElectronicHands
simulating electronichands for capstone project

we examine virtual hands by editing signal.SIGNALS.
but, there are already exist fano signals. it is okay to ignore.

the basic operation is AND between signal and mask. (this is for speed)

Code description
  - Signal.py : Managing about generating signal.
  - Rotate.py : Managing about rotation and transposition matrix. 
  - CoordinateSystem.py : Implement DH and Get coordinates
  - Draw.py : Drawing and Generating Electonic Hand by using tkinter.


here is simulating movies both fano and gray.
